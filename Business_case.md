# Alzheimers Datachallange

## Business case

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinkumar413/alzheimer-mri-dataset

The dataset contains MRI images of human brains, with the labels Very Mild Demented, Mild Demented, Moderate Demented and Non Demented. With this given data a CNN can be trained to detect the status of the patient as one of the mentioned labels. The Pictures for each label are vaguely the same amount except for the Moderate Demented pictures. For this label there are only 64 images present.

The exact business case of this project would be that doctors could save time since they already have a very loaded schedule. When an MRI of a brain is taken the model could determine if there is a chance for the patient to have alzheimers. This would help the Doctor to make a diagnose quicker or to faster rule out alzeheimers as a cause for the patients problems.

The learning goal would be to deal with the lack of moderate demented labeled picutres and also find out which configuration of the CNN will provide the highest accuracy.
