# Repository for DASC2 Data Challenge 23/24 - Group F
- [Business Case](./Business_case.md)

## Ideas
- one-hot encoding
- different activation functions (non binary classification sigmoid might not provide best result Max,Argmax,Softmax)
- create more sample data for moderate Demented label -> mirroring, upside down etc...


## Goal for next week (consideration)
- deal with data issues (moderate Demented)
- research about activation function to use
- Exploratory data analysis (even out the data)
